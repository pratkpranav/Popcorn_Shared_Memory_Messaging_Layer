This code could be used for checking the working for interrupts mechanism.

About:- This code uses ivshmem-doorbell interrupt mechanism to interrupt mechanism and could be used to check whether the doorbell interrupts are working correctly or not. I have already configured it for using 4 MSI-X vector at a time. Two things you need to keep in mond while using this code
i. DEST_ID -> destination whom you want to send interrupt. It is actually the peer id assigned by the ivshmem-server while VM installed.
ii. Checking dmesg whether the interrupt handlers ran or not. 

Usage:- 
1. start the ivshmem server on host first with commands(even before starting the VMs): ivshmem-server -F -v -n 4
2. After starting the server on host, Then start both the VMs with these command added to the initial command: -device ivshmem-doorbell,chardev=ivshmem -chardev socket,path=/tmp/ivshmem_socket,id=ivshmem (Do not leave space after or before equalto sign)
3. Rename the object files with the name of file you want to run.
4. first run sudo insmod x86.ko/arm.ko (source from where you want to send interrupts)
5. then run sudo insmod x86.ko/arm.ko (on the destination VM) run dmesg command on second VM you will be able to see what you have written from other VM. 


Problems: 
1. Couldn't rmmod. Need to restart VM every time you use it.
